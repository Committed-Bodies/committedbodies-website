Z﻿umba fitness is an interval class involving both Latin-inspired-dance and cardio. Created by Columbian dancer and choreographer Beto Pérez, this became a worldwide fitness movement now practiced in over 180+ countries.

﻿Moving between high-intensity and low-intensity dance moves, the program is designed to raise your heart rate and boost your cardio burn - all while having fun.
