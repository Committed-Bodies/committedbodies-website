Always use responsibly 

Some tips, etiquette, and advice

* Always wipe the sunbed yourself before and after any session. 
  No cosmetics, makeup, or medicinal topical creams.
  Use sunscreen for indoor tanning
  Know your own skin - always keep all sessions short.
  10 minutes equates to 2+ sun hours
  Very sensitive skin  - do not use, stay out of the sun - you are not likely to tan either way.
  If you burn easily in the sun, keep the sessions a few days apart (3-4) at least.
  If you have a more sun-ready skin, allow at least 24 -36 hours between sessions.
  No more than 3 sessions per week.
  Always wear eye protection.
  Make sure to protect sensitive areas.
  Always hydrate.
