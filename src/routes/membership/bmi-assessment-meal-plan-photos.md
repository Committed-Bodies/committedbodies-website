We offer a professional BEFORE photo, together with the measurement of your body and weight.  This is handy to have as a starting point when joining the gym.  It is always great to have this to show off to your family and friends, once you have achieved your goals.

Should you wish to have a menu worked out for you, this will fall under the nutrition fee of R1200 – see the [Sports Nutrition Consultation service](https://committedbodies.co.za/services/nutrition-consultation/)
