I'm a personal trainer specialising in:
Strength development
strength-based rehabilitation - for clients that want to improve following an injury and prevent further injuries, not just recover from it.

I have 13 years of experience and have worked with various athletes from powerlifters, and various team sports, as well as clients, wishing to increase their functional fitness and general health. 

I have extensive knowledge of supplements, nutrition, and herbal remedies to keep clients at peak performance and feeling great in and outside the gym.

I follow a strength-based approach to weight loss and body transformation. I believe 'bodybuilding and transformation' should be a progressive development of the body and not just weight loss

I have courses and experience for
Pre and post-pregnancy training
Training for 60+ years of age
Toddlers and kids foundation training
Most sports conditioning 
Boxing and boxing fitness
