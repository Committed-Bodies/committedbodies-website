My name is Julienne Myburgh. I am a proud co-owner together with my husband Jacques, of Committed Bodies.

I have always been interested in healthy living and decided in 2000 to complete my personal training and aerobic and spinning course. Previously, I owned a health shop in the East Rand Mall, and from there my interest in living healthy just increased. I’ve done numerous courses on nutrition and have my diploma in “Sports Nutrition”.

One of my babies at Committed Bodies is a program that helps people of all ages and sizes, the 'Take Back Your Life programme'. This is a programme teaching people how to learn to listen to their bodies and train and eat correctly, in order to stay younger, fitter, and healthier for longer. It is a real passion of mine to see people succeed in their goals and achievements.

Besides the gym, I have 2 teenage boys, who also enjoy the benefits of training and eating healthy. I love music and socialising and just enjoy being around a lot of people.

I have a lot of mistakes that I make along the way, but I am never afraid of apologising and I enjoy enormous challenges that come my way.

I will endeavour to keep everyone on their path to success and take them by the hand if need be, to get them to their results.
