The day I turned 52, I looked in the mirror and did not recognise the woman staring back at me. I had lost my energy, enthusiasm and figure. I looked like I felt - old, flabby and tired. I had two choices - continue down this road, or I could *take back my life.* Nine months later I had transformed my body and my life.

In 2018, my husband and I launched Committed Bodies Gym. We specialise in transformations - our mission is to help *you* take back your life.
