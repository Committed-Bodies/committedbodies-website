Why should I be your first choice as a personal trainer...

Not only have I been exactly where you are but I know exactly how to get you to where you want to be. 

I like to believe that my military background and experience makes my training not only effective but avoids repetitive routines. My background as a amateur pro fighter also brings something special and different into my training style, not only will I push you to your limits physically but mentally as well and this is where progress is made. I am passionate about a healthy life and respect the hard work that goes into it. Let me support you on your journey and let's reach your goals together.
