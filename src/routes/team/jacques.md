Hi, I am Jacques Myburgh, co-owner together with my wife Jill of Committed Bodies.

I am a tool maker by trade and I have a degree in civil engineering.
I got interested in healthy living when I saw the results of Jill changing our lifestyle to eating and training healthily. In a matter of 4 weeks, I lost 10kg on a body challenge which I won and since then, I have enjoyed the benefits of this lifestyle.

I encourage anyone to join our facility. The various exercise regimes we offer will have an impact on the way you look at life. Not only do you look and feel better, but your mindset is different and the power and energy you have from living a healthy lifestyle is very rewarding.

My hobbies are rally-driving, hunting, fishing, and building vehicles for the sport of rally.\
I enjoy supporting Jill in her passion to drive people to live healthily. Seeing the results of the groups from their before and after pictures is really amazing.
