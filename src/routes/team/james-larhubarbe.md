I’m a Trainer specialising in Group training in the areas of: 
1. Aerobics - High and Low-intensity Cardio training such as HIIT, Tabata, Cardiolates, Kickboxing, Xtreme burn workout, and Bootcamp; 
2. Functional training with an emphasis on Flexibility, mobility, and building core strength, and YogiStretch - stretching with a hint of Yoga. 
3. Spinning- I’m passionate about Spinning: It’s one of the high-intensity training classes where you burn tons of calories, build stronger leg, glute, and core muscles. 

I have various training programs and schedules targeting a Strength or Cardio workout and at times a combination of both. Come and try our 'Virtual Spinning class' - an experience like no other Spinning class; I promise you once you have felt the enormous benefits you will be addicted to it, and you’ll also enjoy the music!


I became a trainer after spending years in the Corporate environment and truth be told, I have never felt as truly fulfilled after a day’s work as I do as a trainer. I love the work and the interaction with people in my classes. I believe that as a trainer, it is important to understand the needs of each and every person who is attending your class.

The fact that the person has taken the first step to join the gym with the mindset to improve his/her life in any shape or form, makes it my duty to provide the expertise to achieve whatever his/her goals are in a reasonably short period of time, in a safe and purposeful manner. 

I’ve been training people for almost a decade; however, I still get goosebumps when I see people who were initially shy and reserved being transformed into outgoing, self-confident individuals while embracing a new healthy lifestyle.
