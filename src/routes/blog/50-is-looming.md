I have always loved sport and gym but as we get older, life with its challenges takes over and we simply don’t afford yourself the luxury of personal space & time. Eventually we become demoralised around the effort associated with getting back into shape.

This year started and presented itself with its own set of daunting challenges and stress which sent my emotions on a roller-coaster ride of its own. I realised it was up to me to do something to get me focused and back on track.

A friend referred me to Jill and when I saw her “Take back your life” challenge and photos it was all the inspiration I needed to start the journey and do something. As I’m turning 50 next year I wanted to be associated and train with someone who understands the challenges mature ladies face.

It is seriously not that easy to change years of bad behaviour and quick fix diets and neglect. But with perseverance, continuous motivation and support over the last 3-months I have become stronger, fitter and more motivated than I have ever been in long time.

They say “you are what you eat” so the prepared meal plans they offer at a nominal cost are totally awesome, very tasteful and convenient.

Besides the fact that people are noticing the change this has brought about it seriously feels like I am operating and coping at a different level again.

“Age is not excuse” the journey starts with you, go for it “Take back your life”
