  THE WOMAN STARING BACK AT ME.

I had lost my energy, enthusiasm and figure. I looked like I felt – old, flabby and tired. I had two choices – continue down this road, or I could take back my life.

The beautiful-people in the gym adverts made me doubt my resolve. “Sure”, I thought, “there’s no way my fifty-two-year-old body is going to look like that”. Still, I hated the idea of just giving up and resigning myself to the inevitable. So I enlisted the help of a nutritionist and a trainer.

It was not an easy year. There were frustrations, cheating and feelings of guilt, sore muscles and cold winter mornings when all I wanted to do was roll over and go back to sleep. With the support of my husband, I battled through one day at a time. Eventually, the work began paying off – the flabbiness started slipping away to reveal the muscles and toned figure hiding beneath. And as my body started transforming, so too did my passion for life. Now, I look in the mirror and see a hero, a woman with commitment and guts – GI Jill.

I also discovered a talent and passion for helping other people transform themselves. If you are willing to commit I will help you [take back your life](https://committedbodies.co.za/services/take-back-your-life/).
