Lockdown challenge: We started 2020’s first [Take Back Your Life](https://committedbodies.co.za/about-us/) challenge in March 2020. Then lockdown happened. The ladies were so demoralised – it takes so much commitment to start this challenge – for some people an interruption like this could be insurmountable. We encouraged them to carry on with the training online and to continue with the meal-plans we gave them. Against all odds, this group of ladies demonstrated their tenacity – the final results speak for themselves. Everyone is truly happy with their outcome and ready to start the next three-month stint.

Congratulations to Yvonne van Zyl – the winner of the Take-Back-Your-Life lockdown challenge. She defeated the odds in difficult circumstances. Her prize? 14cm off the hips!
