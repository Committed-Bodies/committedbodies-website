What a walk (jog) down memory lane! Everyone dressed in their What an amazing day we had today – lots of fun reminiscing the 80s. Explosive training done by Chris from #foxshadow. Then we went into a pilates class. We’ll done to Adri du Toit for best dressed and to Danie du Preez and Tanya De Jager for keeping up with the trainer. Mr Fantastic Jacques Myburgh almost got hammered by James Larhubarbe. Everyone enjoyed a free smoothie in our Health Thyme Grill. Join us every Saturday – free bootcamp for all.
